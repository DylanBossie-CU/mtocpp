mtoc++ Installation instructions
 
# Software requirements
The following programs need to be available on your machine:
- Doxygen: mtoc++ is pretty useless witout doxygen. If not yet available, get it at http://www.doxygen.org
- Ragel: A finite-state machine compiler. Get at http://www.complang.org/ragel
- CMake: Cross-platform make. Get at http://www.cmake.org

# Compiling
The following procedure is an example of how to compile mtoc++ on a linux machine:

tar -xcvf mtocpp.tar.gz
cd mtocpp
# Create build folder (optional, but more clean)
mkdir build 
cd build
# Run cmake
cmake .. 
make install

# Customization
If you want the "make install" command to copy the binaries and documentation to different locations, you can choose them by setting the following variables:
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Set this to whatever location you want mtoc++ to be installed. Note that the binaries are copied into a "bin" folder in that folder in order to comply with linux standards.
- CUSTOM_DOC_DIR: This value is "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/doc/mtocpp" per default.

So typing 
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/my/root/dir" -DCUSTOM_DOC_DIR="/my/docs" ..
will copy the binaries to /my/root/dir/bin and the documentation to /my/docs.

Have fun!
