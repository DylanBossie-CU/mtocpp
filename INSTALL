In order to compile this program and install it on your computer, you need to
install the Ragel state machine (http://www.complang.org/ragel/).

Afterwards you can build and install the programme with cmake. Under Unix for
example like this:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/directory ..
make install

Have fun!
