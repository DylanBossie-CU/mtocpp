 * @attention The repeated occurence of the new features/changes in this specific site below is just due to the fact that
 * the mtoc++ features/changes themselves have to be written down somewhere. Under usual circumstances those tags below
 * would be placed inside the MatLab files/functions/classes where the actual change happened; see the comments
 * from the MatlabDocMaker as an example. So the list below is not necessarily complete, but the sites referenced above contain all
 * new features / changes!
