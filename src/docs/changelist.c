 * @page changes Changes and new features in mtoc++
 * @short Changelog and new feature list for mtoc++
 *
 * Here are all the changes/new features sorted by versions of mtoc++:
 * - @subpage newfeat01  - @subpage changelog01
 * - @subpage newfeat12  - @subpage changelog12
 * - @subpage newfeat13  - @subpage changelog13
 *
 * @attention The repeated occurence of the new features/changes in this specific site below is just due to the fact that
 * the mtoc++ features/changes themselves have to be written down somewhere. Under usual circumstances those tags below
 * would be placed inside the MatLab files/functions/classes where the actual change happened; see the comments
 * from the MatlabDocMaker as an example. So the list below is not necessarily complete, but the sites referenced above contain all
 * new features / changes!
 *
 * @change{1,3,md,2011-12-13} changed format for documentation of default properties and parameters
 *
 * @change{1,3,md,2011-12-13} Default arguments for properties are added to the properties documentation block

 *
 * @change{1,3,md,2011-12-04} Bugfix reported by Evgeny Pr on mathworks: allow property definitions not ended by semicolons.
