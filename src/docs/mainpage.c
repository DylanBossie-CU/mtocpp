/**
 * @mainpage mtoc++ Software Documentation
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The mtoc++ software comprises two programs to build nice Doxygen documentation for Matlab projects.
 * 
 * The filter program 'mtocpp' transforms relevant parts of the M-Files into C++ syntax, which can be parsed by doxygen.
 * The generated html files can be processed by the program 'mtocpp_post' in order to generate documentation looking more like Matlab.
 *
 * Short mtoc++ feature list:
 * - Transforms function m-files into standalone functions
 * - Supports most of the OOP features from Matlab.
 *
 * See the @ref examples.Class class for detailed examples on how to use mtoc++ with Matlab.
 * The documentation has been created using mtoc++.
